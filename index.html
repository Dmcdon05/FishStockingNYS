<h3>New York Freshwater Fishing</h3>

<p>New York state boasts some of the best freshwater fishing areas in all of North America. New York’s lakes, rivers, and streams offer a wide variety of world class fishing and a plethora of species. People come from all over to explore and fish these pristine bodies of water and experience the fish they have to offer. <a href="https://www.newyorkupstate.com/outdoors/2020/02/ny-freshwater-fishing-generates-more-than-2-billion-annually-supporting-10000-plus-jobs.html">A 2018 survey from the DEC</a> (Department of Environmental Conservation) estimates that freshwater angling in the state generates over two billion dollars in revenue and provides around 11,000 jobs. Obviously, fishing is an important industry in New York, and at the heart of the industry is the fish. What a lot of people do not know about is the impact of fish stocking in sustaining these environments and the fishing industry.

<h4>DEC Spending and Efforts</h4>

<p>The DEC spends around <a href="https://www.stargazette.com/story/news/2017/09/28/new-york-hatcheries-boost-economy-bolster-recreation/665287001/">$9 million dollars</a> a year operating its hatcheries and stocking fish according to Commissioner Basil Seggos. Most of this funding comes from the sale of sporting licenses. Some may think this is a lot of money to spend on fish, but the fish are an integral part of the ecosystem and ultimately the economy.</p>

<p>Human impact has caused a great deal of damage to natural environments in the last couple of centuries. New York is no different, and once beautiful natural bodies of water have been polluted and overfished. The rising population and increasing interest in fishing New York has led to increases in angler effort on popular bodies of water across the state. The increased pressure on these natural environments puts a lot of pressure on the native species, and we have seen a drastic decrease in native fish populations over the last couple of decades. Once beautiful bodies of water like Onondaga lake have faced serious environmental pressure and pollution. Efforts by the DEC to set regulations and stock fish have been integral to sustaining these ecosystems. </p>



<p>Since 2011, the DEC has stocked over 2.3 billion freshwater fish in New York. These fish are raised in a hatchery and released into the wild to supplement and control existing populations. The number of fish being stocked varies from county to county and depends on necessity and bodies of water in the areas. The bodies of water receiving the highest number of stocked fish in the last 10 years, Oneida Lake and Black Lake, both fall within the two counties with the highest number of fish stocked.</p>

<p>New York has the <a href="https://exploregeneseevalley.com/entries/caledonia-fish-hatchery/f7e1906c-8c6f-43c9-b80d-79a20ccbe5d9">oldest existing hatchery</a> in the western hemisphere according to the DEC. The first hatchery in Caledonia, which is in Livingston county, was purchased by New York State in 1870. Fish stocking has been around for over 150 years, and it has been integral to sustaining ecosystems and a whole industry. Numbers suggest that stocking has been steadily increasing over the years, and in the past ten years, the number of fish stocked in New York state has increased by around 35 million fish. Since 2011, fish stocking numbers have experienced around 14% growth as of 2021. Four of the five last years have seen the highest fish stocking numbers ever in the state.

<h5>Hatcheries and Stocking Specifics</h5>

<p>According to Bill Evans, Manager of the Oneida Fish Hatchery, fish populations would be decimated without the help of fish stocking. Whole species could be wiped out, and the whole industry would change. The Oneida Fish Hatchery is one of the state’s three warmwater hatcheries, so it focuses on warmwater species like walleye, muskellunge, and lake sturgeon. Walleye is the state’s most popularly stocked fish, and it is one of the premier eating fish in the New York. The Oneida Fish Hatchery also focuses on efforts to stock more rare species like tiger muskellunge and lake sturgeon. Lake sturgeon are incredibly rare and have many restrictions prohibiting catching and targeting them. Similarly, Tiger Muskellunge are a rare genetic cross breed that exist mainly as a result of hatcheries. A “tiger muskie” is considered a prized catch and rare game fish for any angler, and many anglers in New York fish for them. The work of hatcheries and fish stocking has created an opportunity for these fish to exist and thrive in an ecosystem.

<p>Biologists do a lot of research and monitoring of populations to make sure fish are being stocked properly, according to Evans. There is a lot of science and collaboration behind the stocking process, and it has seen tremendous growth in the last couple of decades. Some argue that fish stocking can negatively impact native populations by competing for food and preying on them, but there have been major advancements and efforts to eliminate these problems.</p>


<p>New York hatcheries are very deliberate about how they stock and raise fish. Particularly the state’s trout stocking program is very meticulous and strategic. New York supports some of the greatest trout fishing in the country, and it is the systematic work of fish stocking that keeps many of these ecosystems in check. The state has been using a <a href="https://www.newyorkupstate.com/outdoors/2021/01/angler-alert-the-decs-new-categorization-of-trout-streams-and-how-theyll-be-stocked-this-year.html">catch rate-oriented trout stocking (CROTS) </a> strategy since the 1990’s. The system takes into account the number of fish a body of water can support and the amount of pressure it receives. Though numbers fluctuate, the data suggests that the number of trout being stocked has been increasing in the last 10 years.

<p>Regardless of species, it is clear that over the last ten years the number of fish being stocked is steadily rising. The economic and environmental impact of the fishing industry is incredibly important to the state of New York. At the heart of sustaining, this industry is fish stocking. The fish being stocked are not only sustaining ecosystems, but they are also sustaining an industry that brings in billions of dollars a year for the state. 
	
</p>

<p>It is clear that New York’s fishing industry and aquatic ecosystems are strongly supported by the efforts of fish stocking. Numbers suggest that fish stocking will continue to become more important, and as technology continues to advance, it could create more benefits for the ecosystem and for fisherman. As for the growth of fish stocking, it seems reasonable to deduce that the numbers will keep rising as human pressure and environmental impact continue to grow. Next time you look at a body of water in New York, remember the efforts of fish stocking in supporting the delicate balance of that beautiful ecosystem.
